When someone asked me about my favorite season, my answer certainly is spring. Because all the plants turn green and come into leaf in spring. And some kinds of flowers also become in bloom. The spring makes the world colorful. For too many people, spring means the beginning of a new year, and the green color of spring represents hope. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, spring has the meaning of fresh and newly born. The newborn seems to bring me energy and enthusiasm all the time.
